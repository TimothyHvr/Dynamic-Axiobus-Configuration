# Dynamic-Axiobus-Configuration
Easy IEC 61131 project with function blocks for the automatic configuration of the Axioline bus

Project developed with PLCNext Engineer 2020.0.1

PLC target: AXC F 2152 FW 2020

This project has been developed entirely in IEC 61131 and it contains the function blocks needed to read the connected modules of the local Axioline modules of the PLCNext and to start the bus.

The commands and the procedure for the Axio bus startup comes from C++ GitHub repository Bus Conductor
